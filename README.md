# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for various sorting algorithms implemented using Python and Pygame. It allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work by providing a graphical representation of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Customize the list to be sorted with random values.
- Real-time visualization of the sorting process.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python sorting_algo_visualizer.py
    ```
2. The Pygame window will open, displaying the sorting visualizer.
3. Use the interface to select different sorting algorithms and see how they work.
